# Day 2

Back at the keep, we were approached by the commanding officer and told to
rescue survivors holed up in a temple currently under attack by raiders.

Using the tunnel shortcut we had utilized earlier, we came out along the river with good cover by
shrubs and bushes that ran along the bank.  From our position, we were able to make out a party of kobolds with a battering ram attacking the main door, and a massive troop patrolling the area at slow intervals.

We found a small group of cultists and kobolds trying to burn through the back door.  We got the drop on them using stealth and made quick worth of the lot.  I had finally recovered my equilibrium on land, and was able to dispatch several foes easily with my javelin.

It wasn't hard to see during the battle that we had begun to operate more effectively as a team. Az, while still an odd one, used his electric breath to flash fry an entire row of people.  I really hope I didn't inhale much when that cultist in front of me turned to ashes.  Yech.

We burst through the backdoor to discover the people in a panic.  Seeking out a calm-looking priest, we made a plan to get the people to safety by retracing our steps.  Zinc and Darwi used an amazing illusion to make the cultists we'd killed appear to be alive.  We found a dragon amulet, but we didn't search their bodies too thoroughly.  It's ghoulish enough rooting around in a corpses' pockets; it's ten times creepier doing it when an illusion of the dead thing is standing right there, watching you.  Anyway, I was really impressed by this display of magic, and Darwi for suggesting it.  I'm not sure what to make of the Tieflings.  They seem a nice enough sort, but they mostly keep to themselves.  Standoffish maybe?

The return to the keep was uneventful. I questioned the priest briefly about apocalyptic prophecy and masks, but he didn't have much to tell me. We weren't able to rest for long, the door leading to the sally port was broken and presented a huge vulnerability, should it be discovered.

Thorn rushed into the room first and I followed.  We were surprised to find an acolyte and several kobolds already there, spilling through the tunnel.  They got the drop on us, and the dwarf was badly wounded.  After his retreat to heal his wounds, I rushed in, with the others at my back.  The fighting was tough due to the cramped quarters, but we held our own.  

I'm a fair hand with the axe, and I was able to strike one of the kobolds from stem to stern.  It was nasty, I'm not gonna lie, but sometimes nasty is what you need if you want to make a room full of attackers turn tail and run out of the room.

With the place cleared, a mage mended the door.

As we emerged into the keep's open courtyard, we were drawn to the parapets.  A smug, ugly (smugly?) half dragon stood below us, his soldiers behind them.  They had four hostages, a woman and three kids.

Dragon guy seemed to be in charge, and he addressed us as we looked down.  Apparently he'd burned everything in town to his satisfaction and wanted to have a fight with our greatest champion.  He let the children go and promised the woman's release after the fight, win or lose, provided the rest of us didn't interrupt. Zinc seemed pretty agitated the whole time, but maybe that was just because he couldn't see over the brick railing?

While I was deciding whether I could take the monster or not, Thorn rushed down and into the courtyard, accepting the challenge.  I appreciate his decisiveness, but I'm starting to wonder if he's brave or just reckless.

The battle started, and the dwarf got off an amazing hit with his axe.  I thought it might be over right then and there, but beyond some irritated surprise, the half dragon seemed unhurt.  He responded with a quick volley of swings with his long sword and spear, and it wasn't long before Thorn fell unconcious.  

True to his word, the half dragon released the final hostage.  That was nice, I guess, but he kicked Thorn while he was down.  So much for honor.  

With the siege ended, we returned to the keep for a long rest.  Thorn was attended to by several healing mages.  My sleep was restless that night.  That dream again...

Before the others awoke in the morning, I took the opportunity to approach our new companion, a druid named Bran.  He had stood against that huge dragon earlier and come away unharmed, and that's no small feat.

We spoke about magic, and, when he realized that I had some druidic knowledge, he taught me a few simple spells to augment my combat ability.  I'm competent enough fighting at sea, but these land-based spells will help me succeed when I'm on land.  It looks like I may be ashore for a while, in fact.  I came here searching for a particular bounty, but after the attack on Greenest, it's no mystery which monster the townspeople will want dealt with.  

That's fine by me; I've never seen a dragon up close before.
